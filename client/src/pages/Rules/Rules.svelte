    Chat Room Etiquette (Chatiquette)<br><br> Just as in real life, there are some
    things that you do and some things that you don't do in chatting. If you are
    relatively new to chatting, reading the following will help you understand
    the unwritten rules or "etiquette" of chat, and help you to communicate with
    others. Don't talk in CAPITAL LETTERS<br><br> In a chatroom, using a lot of CAPITALS
    or UPPER CASE is seen as shouting. Many people find it annoying when a user
    types entirely in capitals. Don't join a chatroom and then leave without
    saying something<br><br> It is considered impolite to enter a chatroom and then
    leave without saying something. Don't idle or lurk in a chatroom<br><br> When you
    are in a chatroom, do take part in the conversation. If you are going to be
    away from your computer for a short time, tell the other users. If you are a
    beginner, be polite and say something like, "I am new to chatting. Can I
    watch quietly for a few minutes?" Be patient<br><br> Try to be patient and wait if a
    user is slow to respond to you during a conversation. Remember that this is
    a person and they may have other things to do at the same time. Don't use
    excessive colours/ASCII art<br><br> Don't use large multi-line ASCII art or
    excessive colours. In some chatrooms it could be considered a flood and you
    might be kicked out.<br><br> In smaller chatrooms, ask if you are welcome When you
    enter a chatroom that has only a few users, ask if it is a private chatroom,
    and if you are welcome there.<br><br> Be friendly. Be polite. Be considerate
    Remember that these are real people you are chatting with. They may have
    different opinions to you and come from very different cultures. Treat them
    properly and respect their opinions, and they will treat you the same.
